- Basic plan
	- Divide array into two halves.
	- Recursively sort each half.
	- Merge two halves.

- Assertions: Statement to test assumptions about your program.
	- Helps detect logic bugs.
	- Documents code.

- Java assert statement. Throws exception unless boolean condition is true.

		assert isSorted(a, lo, hi);
- Can enable or disable at runtime.  -->> No cost in production code.
- Use assertions to check internal invariants; assume assertions will be disabled in production code.

 - Bottom down vs bottom up

- Comparators

- Stability
